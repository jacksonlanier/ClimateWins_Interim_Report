# Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins


## Overview
This project aims to use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change. Increases in extreme weather events over the last 10 to 20 years have prompted ClimateWins to investigate climate and weather. ClimateWins is a fictitious European non-profit created for the purposes of this project. However, the weather and climate concerns discussed are very real! 


## Data Sources
The data used for this project consists of weather observations from 18 weather stations across Europe. The data has been collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset project](https://www.ecad.eu/) and includes daily observations from 1960 through most of 2022.
